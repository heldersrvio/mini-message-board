# Mini Message Board

![Home screen](https://i.imgur.com/Nq6RogO.png)

A simple message board application created with Express and Pug.

The home screen displays a set of (hard-coded) messages along with the names of the people who posted them and the date they were posted. You can click on the 'New message' link to be redirected to a form that allows you to enter your name, your message and submit it to the board. Then, you'll be redirected to the home screen, where you'll be able to see your new messages.

Note: there is no real persistence in this project, so your messages will not stay there upon a new deploy.
